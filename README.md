# Notes
- Some Large Files cannot be pushed. (simulation/qsim/work/_lib1_30.qpg)
- To run testbench, just use compile and synthesis option, then in tools go for run simulation and choose RTL. You need to specify the Modelsim path for it.
- For me this path worked D:\Quartus\modelsim_ase\win32aloem
- Please find the ISA design in the root directrory in PDF format.
- Current Block connection can be found in the root directory.
